Zhang was the WBO interim world haveyweight champion until losing to Parker in March by majority decision. The 40-year-old had previously defeated Joe Joyce in back-to-back fights in 2023 and now looks to get back to winning ways.

Staring him down from the other side of the ring is Wilder, who was last in action in December when he fell to Parker by unanimous decision. The Bronze Bomber has lost three of his last four bouts and needs a big victory if he wants to get back into the world title picture.
